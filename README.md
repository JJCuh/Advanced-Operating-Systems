The course covers advanced topics in Operating System, including CPU
virtualization, memory virtualization, concurrency and deadlock,
persistence, and security. In addition, the course covers current active
research topics in distributed Operating System. Substantial
programming projects are required.

The purpose of this course is to offer a graduate level coverage to
operating systems and systems software principles. The course
assumes a prior knowledge of the basic concepts of operating systems,
common to most computer systems, and offers a more detailed
coverage of key ideas as well as more advanced concepts such as
NUMA and RDMA. 

The successful student should be able to explain
basic components of a computer operating system, as well as more
advanced concepts of general systems software.
